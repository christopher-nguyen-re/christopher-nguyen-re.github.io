Got Hax

<!--truncate-->

## The Challenge

File can be downloaded [here](/files/got_hax/got_hax) (Right click and open in new tab).

The goal of this challenge is to get the flag.

## Analysis

I opened the executable in ghidra and found the function `get_your_flag`. It reads a key file and prints the flag.

In `main`, there is a printf vulnerability. A printf call is made using a user provided argument on the command line. If we can overwrite the GOT address for `puts` to be the address for `get_your_flag`, then we will be able to obtain the flag.

I ran the executable and sent several `%p`s as input for printf. I was able to view addresses on the stack and determined that the 6th value was the one that could be overwritten because it is the ASCII value for %p. We are writing this value to the stack.

## The Solve

I used pwntools to get the `puts` GOT address and replace it with `get_your_flag` using printf's %n vulnerability.
