Pico CTF: Stonks

<!--truncate-->

## The Challenge

This challenge can be found [here](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/105?bookmarked=0&page=1&search=stonks).

The provided source file [here](/files/stonks/vuln.c)
Given an application, the goal is to find the flag.

## Analysis

I first looked through the source file to get an idea of where the flag could be stored within the program. In main, the buy_stonks function opens a file and stores the flag into api_buf. The location of api_buf on the stack would be a point of interest.

```c
int buy_stonks(Portfolio *p) {
    if (!p) {
        return 1;
    }
    char api_buf[FLAG_BUFFER];
    FILE *f = fopen("api","r");
    if (!f) {
        printf("Flag file not found. Contact an admin.\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    fgets(api_buf, FLAG_BUFFER, f);

    int money = p->money;
    int shares = 0;
    Stonk *temp = NULL;
    printf("Using patented AI algorithms to buy stonks\n");
    while (money > 0) {
        shares = (rand() % money) + 1;
        temp = pick_symbol_with_AI(shares);
        temp->next = p->head;
        p->head = temp;
        money -= shares;
    }
    printf("Stonks chosen\n");

    // TODO: Figure out how to read token from file, for now just ask

    char *user_buf = malloc(300 + 1);
    printf("What is your API token?\n");
    scanf("%300s", user_buf);
    printf("Buying stonks with token:\n");
    printf(user_buf);

    // TODO: Actually use key to interact with API

    view_portfolio(p);

    return 0;
}
```

There is a printf vulnerability where `printf(user_buf)` is called. `scanf` stores input from stdin into user_buf, allowing us to manipulate the format string interpreted by the printf function. Entering %x as input resulted in the following output.

![stonks %x output](/img/stonks/stonks_percent_x.png)

This worked because the x86 calling convention retrieves parameters requested in the format string from the stack. The `printf` function cannot determine a mismatch between the format string and the number of arguments provided in the `printf` function. The function does not have a marked boundary so it will fetch data that does not belong to the function call.

The output turned out to be an address on the stack. The location of api_buf was further up the stack so I hand jammed a lot of %x's into user_buf to try and find api_buf. Looking through the various data on the stack, I notice 6f636970. The converted output from hex to ascii resulted in 'ocip' which meant that the machine was little endian. I read all the data from 'ocip' until a null byte and obtained the flag. The exact offset was 56 bytes away from user_buf. The full flag was 'picoCTF{I_l05t_4ll_my_m0n3y_c7cb6cae}'.
