## The Challenge

This challenge can be found [here](https://decompetition.io/challenges).

The provided executable [here](/files/baby-c/baby-c)

The goal of this challenge is to recreate the baby-c source file so that when it is decompiled, the assembly matches the provided target.

## Analysis

First, I looked at the provided assembly and attempted to figure out the program's general behavior. The challenge tells us that Intel syntax is used.

### Full assembly

```assembly
main:
  endbr64
  push    rbp
  mov     rbp, rsp
  push    rbx
  sub     rsp, 0x18
  mov     [rbp-0x15], 1
block1:
  mov     rax, [stdin]
  mov     rdi, rax
  call    getc@plt.sec
  mov     [rbp-0x14], eax
  cmp     [rbp-0x14], -1
  je      block7
block2:
  call    __ctype_b_loc@plt.sec
  mov     rax, [rax]
  mov     edx, [rbp-0x14]
  movsxd  rdx, edx
  add     rdx, rdx
  add     rax, rdx
  movzx   eax, [rax]
  movzx   eax, ax
  and     eax, 0x2000
  test    eax, eax
  je      block4
block3:
  mov     rdx, [stdout]
  mov     eax, [rbp-0x14]
  mov     rsi, rdx
  mov     edi, eax
  call    putc@plt.sec
  mov     [rbp-0x15], 1
  jmp     block1
block4:
  cmp     [rbp-0x15], 0
  je      block6
block5:
  mov     rbx, [stdout]
  mov     eax, [rbp-0x14]
  mov     edi, eax
  call    toupper@plt.sec
  mov     rsi, rbx
  mov     edi, eax
  call    putc@plt.sec
  mov     [rbp-0x15], 0
  jmp     block1
block6:
  mov     rbx, [stdout]
  mov     eax, [rbp-0x14]
  mov     edi, eax
  call    tolower@plt.sec
  mov     rsi, rbx
  mov     edi, eax
  call    putc@plt.sec
  jmp     block1
block7:
  mov     eax, 0
  add     rsp, 0x18
  pop     rbx
  pop     rbp
  ret
```

### Examining assembly components

```assembly
main:
  endbr64
  push    rbp
  mov     rbp, rsp
  push    rbx
  sub     rsp, 0x18
  mov     [rbp-0x15], 1
```

From main, the stack was allocated and the value '1' is stored on the stack at `[rbp-0x15]`.

```assembly
block1:
  mov     rax, [stdin]
  mov     rdi, rax
  call    getc@plt.sec
  mov     [rbp-0x14], eax
  cmp     [rbp-0x14], -1
  je      block7
```

In block 1, getc is called with stdin as its argument. The return value of getc is moved from eax into `[rbp-0x14]`, a location on the stack. It checks the return value for the value '-1' and jumps to block 7 if it is equal. If it is not equal, the assembly control flow continues into block 2.

```assembly
block2:
  call    __ctype_b_loc@plt.sec
  mov     rax, [rax]
  mov     edx, [rbp-0x14]
  movsxd  rdx, edx
  add     rdx, rdx
  add     rax, rdx
  movzx   eax, [rax]
  movzx   eax, ax
  and     eax, 0x2000
  test    eax, eax
  je      block4
```

`__ctype_b_loc` is an accessor function used by the ctype library. It returns an `unsigned short int**` which points to array of characters in the current locale containing characteristics for each current character set. The character that had been received from `getc` is used and its characteristic was checked to match `0x2000`. `0x2000` was the value for the `_ISspace` constant contained in ctype.h. From this I determined that the `isspace()` function was likely used to check that the character was a space. If this was true, the assembly would jump to block4. Otherwise, it continued to block 3.

```assembly
block3:
  mov     rdx, [stdout]
  mov     eax, [rbp-0x14]
  mov     rsi, rdx
  mov     edi, eax
  call    putc@plt.sec
  mov     [rbp-0x15], 1
  jmp     block1
```

This block simply called `putc` with the character we obtained from `getc` stored at `[rbp-0x14]`. It stored the value '1' into [rbp-0x15] and jumped back to block1. This implied that there was a loop in the main function.

```assembly
block4:
  cmp     [rbp-0x15], 0
  je      block6
```

Block4 checked that the value stored at `[rbp-0x15]` was 0 and jumped to block 6 if true. Otherwise, it continued to block 5. `[rbp-0x15]` gave me the impression that it was being used as a flag for something.

```assembly
block5:
  mov     rbx, [stdout]
  mov     eax, [rbp-0x14]
  mov     edi, eax
  call    toupper@plt.sec
  mov     rsi, rbx
  mov     edi, eax
  call    putc@plt.sec
  mov     [rbp-0x15], 0
  jmp     block1
```

Here, `toupper()` was called with `stdout` and `[rbp-0x14`] as arguments. By this point we already knew that `[rbp-0x14]` is the character we obtain from `getc` stored on the stack. `putc` is then called to print the character. If `toupper` was successful, then this character would be capitalized. Otherwise, the character would be unchanged and printed to `stdout`.

```assembly
block6:
  mov     rbx, [stdout]
  mov     eax, [rbp-0x14]
  mov     edi, eax
  call    tolower@plt.sec
  mov     rsi, rbx
  mov     edi, eax
  call    putc@plt.sec
  jmp     block1
```

This was the same as block5. The only difference was that it called `tolower()` instead of `toupper()`.

```assembly
block7:
  mov     eax, 0
  add     rsp, 0x18
  pop     rbx
  pop     rbp
  ret
```

Block 7 was the point where the main function deallocated stack memory and returned. I expected this to be the end of the main function.

### Running the executable

I ran the executable and observed its behavior to compare my understanding of the assembly.

The first character of every `word` was capitalized if it was a letter. All uppercase letters after the first for each `word` were changed to lowercase. Words were separated by spaces.

This lined up with the assembly as a flag (`[rbp-0x15]`) handles the control flow for whether a character should be capitalized or made lowercase.

## Solving the challenge

I wrote up a program in c to match the executable's behavior along with what I knew from the assembly. I had to modify `if` statements a few times for the control flow to match in assembly.

```c
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  // glhf
  char flag;
  int letter;
  
  flag = 1;
  while (1)
  {
    letter = getc(stdin);
  
    if (letter == -1)
    {
      break;
    }

    if (isspace(letter) != 0)
    {
     putc(letter, stdout);
     flag = 1;
    }
    else
    {
      if (flag != 0)
      {
        putc(toupper(letter), stdout);
        flag = 0;
      }
      else
      {
        putc(tolower(letter), stdout);
      }
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion

This was an interesting challenge and helped me gain a better understanding of the relationship between c and assembly. I learned about calling conventions and how to read the control flow of assembly.
